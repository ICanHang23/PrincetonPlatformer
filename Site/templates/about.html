                <h1>How to Play</h1>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of the game is simple - Get to the end of the level and reach the exit 
                    as quickly as possible! Avoid hazards and make it to the end while competing with
                    others for the fastest time.
                </p>
                <h3>Movement basics</h3>
                <p>To move the player right and left, use the key A to move right, and D to move left.
                    To jump, press either W or the space bar while on the ground. You are able to change 
                    the direction you are moving while airborne. 
                </p>
                <h3>Higher level movement</h3>
                <p>
                    To execute a double jump, press the jump key while in the air. This will give you more
                    vertical momentum, and also a small speed boost in the horizontal direction you are moving. 
                    You are only able to do one double jump before you land on the ground, so if you 
                    have already double jumped, you will need to land before you can execute another 
                    double jump. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To execute a wall jump, be adjacent to a wall and use your directional input towards the wall while
                    pressing jump, which will give you a burst of vertical momentum and horizontal momentum in the direction
                    away from the wall. You can only do walljumps a limited amount of times before you are required to land.
                </p>
                <h3>Hoagie mechanics</h3>
                <p>
                    The hoagie can be thrown using a left click on the mouse, which will launch a hoagie 
                    that is affected by gravity. When the hoagie hits a surface, or the player left clicks
                    again before it hits a surface, the player will be teleported to the location of the hoagie,
                    conserving the momentum the player had prior to the teleportation. The hoagie will always be launched
                    in the direction of the last directional input (A and D) and the angle the hoagie is thrown at can be
                    changed by pressing E to increase the angle, and R to decrease the angle. There is no cooldown to the
                    hoagie, and the moment one expires, another hoagie can be thrown. 
                </p>
                <h3>Hazards</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two main types of hazards. Spikes will instantly kill you on contact, which will send you 
                    back to the last checkpoint, or the beginning of the level if no checkpoint is reached. If you fall off
                    the map, you will also be counted as dying, and sent back to the checkpoint/beginning of the level. You want
                    to avoid either of those scenarios, so try not to make contact with any spike or fall off the map.

                <h3>Prox</h3>
                <p>
                    You may notice that the exit may be blocked off, with a scanner in front of it. In those scenarios,
                    you have to pick up a prox (insert image) and bring it to the scanner to authenticate yourself and 
                    open the door and proceed.
