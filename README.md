# PrincetonPlatformer

This is a Platforming speedrunning game, created over a few months. It has a series of levels that the player can go through, as they try to get to the end of the level. They can then 

# Mechanics

The player has the normal 8 directional inputs with a jump, and a fair amount of air control, to make sure the player has incentive to try and make minute adjustments while in the air. 

The player has a double jump, and if holding a directional input while double jumping, will also gain a small burst of speed in that direction. The burst of speed, while initially a physics bug, was hard coded into the game after it was found to allow for more "clutch" moments, as the player is just barely able to cross that gap thaty they might not have been able to otherwise

The player also has wall jumps, which is input by holding the directional input towards the wall they are adjacent too, and then inputting jump. This will launch the player vertically and horizontally in the opposite direction of the wall. The amount of wall jumps a player can do before having to touch the ground again is 5, to prevent breaking some levels by infinitely jumping over some walls. 

# Level Design

The levels are short, 30 second bite sized levels that are meant to be completed by new players to the platforming genre, while still posing a possible challenge and pushing the player to use all the mechanics and movement tech at their disposal in different ways.
